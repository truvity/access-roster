## Unreleased

The first release has not been cut. This section describes what is in the
repository, not the order it arrived in.

- **directory-roster**, the directory hub: workspaces whose domains are
  discovered, snapshots with the freshness policy (`max_age`, the
  cheapest path, an in-domain miss that always checks live once), routing
  by email domain with conflict detection, and the authority rule that
  makes everything degrade to a hold rather than to "gone".
- **DirectoryService** over ConnectRPC for consumers, authenticated by
  Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens; the operator services, the login
  routes, the consent callback and `/.access/whoami` on a second
  listener.
- **The policy** (`docs/reference/policy.md`): five tables — groups,
  claims, lifetimes, clients, memberships — one schema for both services,
  deep merge with a load-time scalar-conflict check, shortest lifetime,
  layered loading, memberships the only console-writable table, clients
  declared or self-registered and never created in a console. The hub is
  a relying party of it: `hub-operators` and `hub-viewers`.
- **The console** on the fleet stack, organised as the graph the content
  actually is rather than as a set of tables: search on every page, an
  overview that answers whether anything is broken, and a page per
  tenant, group, client and person, each carrying its edges in both
  directions. Every name is a link, every page opens with a
  plain-language summary, and actions live on the object they change.
  The navigation is two clusters, identity and access, with one adjective
  each — directory groups and internal groups — and a page at every level
  of both: a directory group's page mirrors an internal group's, and the
  membership that joins them is editable from either end. A person's page
  is the chain, one row per internal group held. Matchers lists every
  declared rule — the identity side's second way in, by shape rather than
  by membership — and keeps the proof simulator for a CI job or a
  workload, because a run exists only while it runs. A client's page
  lists the machines that reach it beside the people. People filters by
  directory and by whether an account is live. **Add a directory** offers both ways in and only
  the ways the deployment can take. The visual layer follows Material's
  guidance for a console: a navigation rail with the two sides as groups
  and a header kept for search and identity, a denser lowercase theme,
  and one meaning per form — names are links, chips are states, facts are
  a label over a value, and two-column data is a list. The account sits at
  the foot of the rail with your name linking to your own page, which
  also says how you signed in; detail pages split into a main column and
  an aside on wide windows, so a person's chain fits a screen. The
  contract was tightened for it: `Explain` names the directory that
  served the address, `SearchPeople` reports the total before the limit,
  and `GetPolicy` carries matchers only in structured form.
- **A demonstration mode** (`DEMO=1`): two tenants in memory and a
  consent connector, so every use-case is walkable before a credential
  exists.
- **The documentation set**: why it exists, the concepts, the fifteen
  integration points, the architecture, a design per battery, the
  reference pages, one connect guide per kind of relying party, the
  operations runbooks and the extension points.

Designed but not built: access-issuer, access-proxy, the libraries as a
public module, accessctl and the GitHub Action.
